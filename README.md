## Static Website Generator for the Missoula Civic Hackathon

This [common lisp](http://www.sbcl.org) program generates a static
[polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) website to showcase the
second [Missoula Civic Hackathon](http://missoulacivichackathon.org).

Fork it and throw your own civic hackathon!

It's a simple sketch and is open for much further development.
